This is following a pattern if you didn't realise lmao. 

File use: 
python3 readingFromDatabase.py databaseName.db databaseTableName

Pretty self explanatory what this file does it was for reading from the databases I was using at the time. This was the inital copy and then I implemented it into other files.
